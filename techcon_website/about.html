            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Since its inception in 2012, TechCon has grown from a modest developer meetup into one of the most anticipated tech gatherings in Africa. What began as a one-day workshop hosted at a university hall has now transformed into a multi-day conference attracting tech leaders, founders, engineers, and students from across the continent. Over the years, TechCon has introduced new tracks in artificial intelligence, web development, cloud computing, and more, continually adapting to the fast-paced evolution of technology. Each edition builds on the last, empowering communities, launching startups, and spotlighting groundbreaking solutions made in Africa.</p>
